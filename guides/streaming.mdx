## Benefits of Streaming

- **Better UX**: Users see responses immediately
- **Perceived Performance**: Feels faster even if total time is the same
- **Progressive Display**: Long responses appear naturally
- **Lower Memory**: Process chunks instead of waiting for full response

## Implementation Guide

See the [Streaming Examples](/examples/streaming) for complete code samples.

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Always Handle Errors" icon="shield">
    Streams can fail mid-response. Always wrap streaming code in try-catch.

    ```python
    try:
        for chunk in stream:
            # Process chunk
            pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Stream error: {e}")
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Buffer for UI Updates" icon="database">
    Don't update UI for every single chunk - buffer updates for performance.

    ```javascript
    let buffer = '';
    const BUFFER_SIZE = 5;

    for await (const chunk of stream) {
      buffer += chunk.choices[0]?.delta?.content || '';
      if (buffer.length >= BUFFER_SIZE) {
        updateUI(buffer);
        buffer = '';
      }
    }
    // Flush remaining buffer
    if (buffer) updateUI(buffer);
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Track Completion" icon="check">
    Know when the stream is done to update UI state.

    ```python
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].finish_reason:
            # Stream is done
            break
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Store Full Response" icon="save">
    Keep track of the complete response for later use.

    ```python
    full_response = ""
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content:
            content = chunk.choices[0].delta.content
            full_response += content
            print(content, end="")
    # Now full_response contains complete text
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
